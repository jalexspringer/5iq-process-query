A simple script to clean and output top publishers from a 5IQ query output.

The script takes in 1 parameters - the file_name. Will then prompt for prospect and 2 competitor URLS.

In current state, script must be run from the folder with the .xlsx file from 5IQ.

Output is a text file in the same folder called prospectURL.txt. Will open file in text editor for easy sending to the rep that made the request.
